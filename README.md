##  StudyTrack - Course Progress Tracker

**StudyTrack** is a course progress tracking application designed to help students manage their coursework efficiently. The app allows users to create courses, add topics or lectures, and track their confidence levels for each topic. For each topic, users can add any number of lesson objectives and mark which ones they are confident in. Confidence levels for each topic will be automatically calculated based on the percentage of objectives the user has mastered. By providing a clear, consolidated view of their progress, users can quickly identify areas where they need to focus more effort before exams. Future features will include setting milestones, goals, and smart suggestions for study prioritization.

### What will the application do?
StudyTrack enables users to add multiple courses and track their learning progress across various topics or lectures within each course. Users can assign multiple lesson objectives to each topic, record the date of each lecture, and update their confidence by marking which objectives they are confident in. The app will calculate confidence as a percentage of mastered objectives for each topic. Additionally, the app will allow users to view their overall progress in each course and help them assess their readiness for exams.

### Who will use it?
The application is designed primarily for students who want to stay organized and on top of their studies. It can be useful for anyone studying for exams, managing multiple subjects, or looking for a structured way to track learning progress. StudyTrack is ideal for university students, high school students, or anyone pursuing self-directed learning.

### Why this project is of interest to me?
This project is interesting to me because it addresses a common problem students face: managing and organizing their study progress. By creating StudyTrack, I aim to help students prioritize their study time efficiently, track their improvement, and ultimately perform better in their exams. Moreover, it provides me with an opportunity to design a functional application that tackles real-world challenges, allowing me to apply my Java skills in an impactful way.

### Features:
- **Add Courses**: Users can create and manage multiple courses.
- **Add Topics**: For each course, users can list topics, assign multiple lesson objectives, and update their progress by marking objectives as mastered.
- **Track Progress**: Confidence levels for each topic are tracked based on how many objectives the user has mastered, showing progress as a percentage (e.g., 4 out of 5 objectives = 80% confident).
- **View Overview**: Users can view an easy-to-read progress report of all topics within a course and see how many objectives theyâ€™ve mastered.
- **Edit Course/Topic:** Users can update course or topic information as needed, including modifying lesson objectives and progress.
- **Remove Courses/Topics**: Users can remove a course or topic if they no longer need it, keeping their tracker organized.
